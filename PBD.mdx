# What is Precedent Based Drafting

Precedent-Based Drafting (PBD) is a streamlined approach to contract creation that leverages two key elements: **Precedents** and **Instructions**.

## What is a Precedent

A **precedent** is a previously drafted contract or agreement that serves as a template for future use. By leveraging a well-crafted precedent, you can save significant time and ensure consistency across similar transactions. Rather than starting from scratch, you simply adapt the precedent to fit the specifics of the new matter—maintaining preferred language, structure, and risk allocation.

Precedents are typically drawn from:

- Firm or organization-standard templates
- Successful agreements from previous matters
- Industry-standard forms

## What are Instructions

**Instructions** are the specific directions you provide to tailor a precedent to the requirements of a new transaction. These instructions might include:

- Changes to party names or details
- Updates to dates, monetary values, or other variables
- Modifications to particular clauses (e.g., penalties, notice periods, governing law)
- Additions or deletions based on the current deal’s needs

Instructions can be entered as a simple bulleted list (e.g., “Change the parties from Apple (buyer) and Samsung (seller) to Google (buyer) and Bing (seller); increase the lead-time penalty from 15% to 20%”) or uploaded as a document outlining the required changes.

# How to Draft a Contract Using PBD

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open A Blank Word Document" titleSize="h3">

  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch the ContractKen Word Add-In" titleSize="h3">

      alt="image.png"
      title="image.png"
      style={{ width:"30%" }}
    />

    Click on the **_Precedent Based Drafting_** button to start drafting your contract.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload Your Precedent" titleSize="h3">
    <Tip>
      If you have a _Precedent_ uploaded already, you can skip this step.
    </Tip>
    ![download.png](/images/download.png)

    Click on the **Upload Precedent** button [1]. This will open up a file picker for you to pick the contract that you want to use as _precedent_ [2].

    Once you have uploaded the _precedent_, it will become available on the same screen, above the **Upload Precedent** button [3].

    <Note>
      Any _precedent_ contracts that you upload from here will be available on this screen till you delete the precedent from here.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select The Precedent From The List " titleSize="h3">
    Select the precedent that you wish to use for drafting your new contract and click on **_confirm_** when prompted.

    This will populate the chosen _precedent_ onto the blank canvas of the empty word document.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add The Instructions To Draft Your New Contract" titleSize="h3">
    <img
      src="/images/Instructions.png"
      alt="Instructions Pn"
      title="Instructions Pn"
      style={{ width:"31%" }}
    />

    Here, you have 2 options.

    1. Write instructions manually.

       Pick this if you want to type out your instructions manually.
    2. Upload Term Sheet

       Pick this if you have a _Term Sheet_ | _Instruction document_ that you can upload. This will be via a file picker as in the _Upload Precedent_ section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click On Create Draft" titleSize="h3">
    <img
      src="/images/CreateDraft.png"
      alt="Create Draft Pn"
      title="Create Draft Pn"
      style={{ width:"34%" }}
    />

    Click on the **_Create Draft_** button to begin the drafting process.

    This will convert each individual _instruction_ to one or more **_edits_**. These _edits_ will be of 3 types, _inserts_, _updates_ and _deletes_. Each edit will then be applied to the precedent to convert it into a drafted document.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply Edits" titleSize="h3">
    <img
      src="/images/applyall.jpg"
      alt="Applyall Jp"
      title="Applyall Jp"
      style={{ width:"32%" }}
    />

    As seen here, the edits are grouped into 3 sections by type of edit, _Update_, _Delete_ and _Insert._
