# Review Redlines

<Info>
  The **Review Redlines** feature helps you analyze changes (redlines) made by counterparties or collaborators in a contract, providing a detailed report with context and recommendations.
</Info>

## What Are Redlines?

When a contract is edited in "Reviewing" mode in Microsoft Word, all changes appear as redlines—insertions, deletions, and comments—rather than direct edits to the text. This allows lawyers and counterparties to clearly see what has been changed or suggested.

> _In Reviewing mode, all edits are tracked as redlines and can be accompanied by comments for clarity or negotiation._

## How To Use Review Redlines
